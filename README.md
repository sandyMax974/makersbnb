# MakersBnB

## Description
This was our first group project and we had to create an AirBnB clone, based on a list of requirements given by stakeholders (Makers' coaches). This aim of the week was to answer 'yes' to the following: 
> Can you, with only a specification to guide you, work as part of a team to build a web app?

This was difficult as it was the first time we had to break down tasks and assess their sizes as a group, whilst still getting use to building a web-app using Sinatra and REST achitecture.

We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

Headline specifications
- Any signed-up user can list a new space.
- Users can list multiple spaces.
- Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
- Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
- Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
